# Through-The-Window-Of-Our-Heart
<p>A project that i will be working on for the next years, it is based to help people open up to each other after seeing the lack of talks we as people have after so many incidents that occur to us, it is a good thing to open up but a better thing to be on a clear page with the other, it'l take a few more updates till i feel pleased with this project but all it matters is its goal and message to the world</p>
